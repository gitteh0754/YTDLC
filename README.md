# YTDLC

**Y**ou**T**ube **D**own**l**oad **C**.L.I

It's a simple YouTube downloader client not made for speed, but for ease-of-console-use.

GUI coming soon.

## Usage

```
ytdlc download <link> <audio|video>
```

\<link> = The link you want to download from.

<br/>
So, after you enter this command, the CLI does some black magic using FFMPEG and downloads the highest quality audio or video stream from that YouTube video, and remuxes them to have audio (in the case of a non-progressive video stream).

<br/>

Yeah. That's all there is to it.

## Installation

First, get the installer **(windows only)** from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/gitteh0754/YTDLC/releases) (sorry for those of you on CodeBerg), and run it.

Then, refresh your path variable.

Finally, profit.
